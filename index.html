  <section>
    <div class="block-title">Block</div>
    Block-level elements always start on a new line and take
        up the full width available (stretching left to right
        as far as possible)
    <div class="block-element">BLOCK</div>
    <div class="block-element">BLOCK</div>
    Examples include div, nav, header,
        section, footer, and ul elements.
  </section>


  <section>
    <div class="inline-title">Inline</div>
    Inline elements do not start on a new line and
        only  occupy the space that their content requires.
        <span class="inline-element">INLINE</span>. Some examples of inline elemetns include
        span, input, label, select and a.

  <section>
    <div class="inline-block-title">inline-block</div>
    Inline-block is set by the CSS display property
        and differs to inline elements as we can set
        width and height. We cannot do this width
        inline elemetns as they only take the space their
        content needs. Also, top and bottom margins
        and paddings are respected, but inline elements
        they are not.
        <div class="inline-block-element">INLINE-BLOCK</div> <div class="inline-block-element">INLINE-BLOCK</div>. Unlike block-level elements,
        inline-block elements do not start on a new
        line and will sit next to other elements.
